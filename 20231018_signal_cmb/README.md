## signal_cmb

This 'signal_cmb' module contain the codes that produced the lensed CMBs, as well as the methods to get the T, Q, U CMB-only maps for LiteBird and S4 channels from those CMBs.

These methods are

    maps.get_s4_map

for S4 and 

    maps.get_lb_map

for LiteBird.

See the last few cells of ipynbs/lencmb_verification.ipynb on how to use these
